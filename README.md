### Welcome to my Repository! ðŸ‘‹ Don't mind the mess, i wasn't expecting visitors! ðŸ¤£

Right now, I'm a Junior Data Scientist at Secretaria de Saude do Estado do CearÃ¡ (CearÃ¡'s Health Department)

ðŸ”­ My main language is python, but, as you can see,, at college I had some experience with Java, C, R, MATLAB/Octave, Verilog...

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Engineering in general (Data streaming, data lakes, ETL...)

âš¡ Fun fact: I also play Football as a Linebacker! Don't piss me off or i will tackle you ðŸ˜‚
