### Welcome to my Repository! ðŸ‘‹ Don't mind the mess, i wasn't expecting visitors! ðŸ¤£

I am a Data Engineer working at BEES Brasil, part of the AbInbev Incorporations! Previously, I was a Analytics Engineer at quintoAndar and a Data Scientist at Instituto Atlantico.:) 

ðŸ”­ My main language is python and SQL, but, as you can see, at college I had some experience with Java, C, R, MATLAB/Octave, Verilog...

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about CI/CD in general. Things like docker and such.

âš¡ Fun fact: I also play Football as a Linebacker! Don't piss me off or i will tackle you ðŸ˜‚
